      "Proud to organise ASAB Winter Meeting with the theme 'Animal Movement'",
    text:
      "After months of hard work as part of the scientific organising committee, I am very proud that the conference on Animal Movement of the Association Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour has been successfully held in Edingburgh. We brought together 300 researchers from around the globe for a frutiful 2-day of scientific exchange. I can feel the enthusiasm expressed by many of finally meeting each other face-to-face after almost 3 years since the first COVID lockdown and travel bans. Still there are people who could not be here and we have organised hublets around the globe to follow the conference remotely.",
